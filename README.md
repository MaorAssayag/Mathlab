# Floating Point Convertor 


* After searching the internet, i couldn't find a complete code for convert any number to a floating point arithmetic for any base and number of bits (in matlab) - so i code that.
* ignore any mention of ML1 or MantisaLarger1 VARIABLES (its there to handle input that cant be represent in n bits of mantisa) [floaatingPoint & toBits functions].
* This code is my first introduction to matlab - I am fully aware that isn't optimized, not using any special functions or syntax - but it will give you a good idea where to start.

# The Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Methods

 * Iterative schemes require time to achieve sufficient accuracy and are reserved for large systems of equations where there
 are a majority of zero elements in the matrix. Often times the algorithms are taylor-made to take advantage of the special
 structure such as band matrices.  Practical uses include applications in circuit analysis, boundary value problems and partial
 differential equations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method">more info</a>.
 
 * Consider that the n√ón square matrix A is split into three parts, the main diagonal D, below diagonal L and above diagonal U. 
    We have  A = D - L - U.

 ### Theorem - Jacobi Iteration
 * The solution to the linear system   can be obtained using iteration scheme 
 A sufficient condition for the method to be applicable is that A is strictly diagonally dominant or diagonally dominant and
 irreducible.
